        <h2> Tip 1 </h2>
        <h3>Be patient</h3>
        <p>Some plants take time to acclimate to their new environment. If a few leaves drop off in the first couple of weeks, don not panic! Most likely, this is perfectly normal and is just a sign of your plant adjusting to its new home.</p>

            <h2> Tip 2 </h2>
            <h3>Do NOT overwater your plant </h3>
            <p>The most important thing to remember for all new plant owner is DON'T OVERWATER YOUR PLANT. As you read through the care card information for your specific plant, pay close attention to the watering instructions.One of the most common mistakes I see new plant parents make is giving their plants too much water. A good rule of thumb for most plants is to water when the top 1-2 inches of soil is dry (use your finger to test the soil). Plants do not like to sit in soggy soil, so make sure you are dumping out the excess water from the saucer after watering.</p>

            <h2> Tip 3 </h2>
            <h3> Choose the right spot </h3>
            <p>Choosing the right spot for your indoor plants begins with choosing the right plant for the light you have. Some of the best indoor plants, like the Orbifolia Plant, Monstera, or Philodendron Heartleaf are fairly low maintenance and can adapt and thrive in a myriad of light environments from low to bright, indirect light. Other plants, like the Hedgehog Aloe need bright light for a large part of the day to thrive. Some, can adapt to and even prefer low light, darker areas.
