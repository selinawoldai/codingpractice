        <h2> Reserved Personality</h2>
        <p>What makes up the reserved personality is:
            <ul>
               <li>Low extroversion</li> 
               <li>Low agreeableness</li>
               <li>Low neuroticism</li>
               <li>Low openness</li>
                <li>Highly conscientious</li>    
                
            </ul>
            You take pride in owning up to your responsibilities and 
            you enjoy rising up to the challenge. As for plant caring, a plant that's hard 
            to care for might be what you need. And you might even enjoy it. 
            "Plants that require a bit more care, but are also fast growing will help the reserved person 
            feel accomplished and rewarded,‚Äù she says.
